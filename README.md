### Attention_Module_YOLOv8
The ultralytics folder is forked from the [Ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) repository.
The Datasets folder contains the link to the datasets used in this work. After downloading the datasets, the corresponding files should be unzipped under the same folder name.

The preprocessing notebook folder contains a few notebooks used for preprocessing the images compatible with this work. The notebooks inside this folder are not mandatory to train the model as the datasets are already processed and can directly feed into the network. 

The data-cfg folder contains the training configuration for the dataset training setup. 

The graph folder contains the notebooks used to generate graphs and images for the result section.
